## 👋 Hi there, I'm Goker

I'm a computer engineer, designer, photographer, gardener — and builder of weird but beautiful things.

### ⚙️ Projects I Built, Broke, and Rebuilt

- [📚 **Codes / Models / Datasets**](https://goker.dev/)  
  → My academic research base: NLP, SEO, AI experiments, and probably something cursed.
  
- [✓ **trustthe.dev**](https://trustthe.dev)  
  → A minimal UI component that signs your frontend — for developers who version everything, including themselves.

- [🎨 **Echoneo**](https://goker.art/echoneo)  
  → AI generative art system powered by prompt logic, historical aesthetics, and prehistoric sass.

- [🧠 **API for Everything**](https://kodkafa.com/)  
  → Modular, no-bullshit API service. Custom-built. Surprisingly stable.

- [📈 **SEO Analyzer**](https://basepart.com/)  
  → AI-powered, multi-report, deep-dive web analysis system. You’ll be amazed. Or terrified.

- [🎮 **Pokking**](https://pokking.com/)  
  → Satirical 2D game where world leaders poke stuff. Built with a physics engine and bad intentions.

### 🤖 Goker-ish GPT is Alive

My AI alter ego is now live — ask it anything from tech to plants, from design critiques to existential tangents.

But its real superpower?  
It reviews your photos like I would: with composition analysis, color scoring, human-toned feedback, and a slight vermillion obsession.
